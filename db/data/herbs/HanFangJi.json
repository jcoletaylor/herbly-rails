Aristolochiae Fangchi #{GuangFangJi} Guang Fang Ji is better at eliminating Wind and Dampness, while this herb is a stronger diuretic. Guang Fang Ji is more for upper body edema, while Han Fang Ji is more for lower body edema. If neither is specified, this herb is usually used.","Both Han Fang Ji and Caulis Akebiae #{MuTong} Mu Tong are very bitter and very cold and both descend to strongly clear Heat, facilitate the Fluid pathways and open the orifices. They are often used together to treat floating edema, urinary difficulty due to Damp-Heat and Wind-Damp Bi. Han Fang Ji is better at facilitating the removal of pathogenic water and expelling Wind and is best used for edema with abdominal distention, wheezing due to Phlegm and thin mucus, and Wind-Damp Bi. Mu Tong excels at clearing Fire from the Heart and Small Intestine channels and invigorating Blood. It is more appropriate for ulcers of the mouth and tongue, rough, painful urination due to overabundant Fire in the Heart and Small Intestine channels and amenorrhea due to Blood Stasis.","Han Fang Ji has a solid, hard texture and was thought to mobilize the Lower Jiao and be superior for expelling Dampness, facilitating water and reducing swelling. It is most often used for Lower Jiao Damp-Heat, edema in the lower body and Damp leg Qi. The texture of Guang Fang Ji was thought to be as light as wood floating on water. Its lightness suggests that its actions move upward and outward to expel Wind, alleviate pain and treat edema in the upper body, as well as Wind-Damp Bi. Because of its toxic properties, it is no longer used."]}
