Panacis Quinquifolii Xi Yang Shen tonify Qi. Xi Yang Shen is sweet, slightly bitter and cooling. It also tonifies and augments the Blood aspect. It can be used to substitute for Ren Shen whenever one wants to tonify Qi without warming.","Xi Yang Shen, Rx. Pseudostellariae #{TaiZiShen} Tai Zi Shen, Rx. Ginseng Ren Shen, and Rx. Codonopsis #{DangShen} Dang Shen all tonify the primal Qi and generate Fluids. Tai Zi Shen is far weaker in effect, requiring a larger dose and its tonifying action is limited to the Lungs and Spleen. Dang Shen tonifies the Spleen Qi but not the primal Qi like Ren Shen, nor does it generate Fluids like Ren Shen and Tai Zi Shen. Xi Yang Shen is equal in strength to Ren Shen but is cooler and has a greater ability to generate Fluids. It is less appropriate when warm tonification is required. In mild cases of Qi and Yin Deficiencies, Tai Zi Shen can be substituted."]}
