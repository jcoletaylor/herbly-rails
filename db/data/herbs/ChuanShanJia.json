Recommended substitutions are: to pierce and promote perforation of sores; Spina Gleditsiae #{ZaoJiaoCi} Zao Jiao Ci, to promote the movement of Blood and promote lactation; Sm. Vaccariae #{WangBuLiuXing} Wang Bu Liu Xing; and to reduce abdominal masses; Eupolyphaga/Steleophaga #{TuBieChong} Tu Bie Chong or Concha Arcae #{WaLengZi} Wa Leng Zi. Although it can dissolve unformed pus, it is better for suppurative sores (topically).","It is used primarily for painful non-ulcerated abscess and joint swelling.","Some sources say that this herb resolves Phlegm, moves Qi and stops bleeding topically and is used to treat wounds.","It is said to treat scabies and leprosy.","One source says it promotes Blood circulation by diminishing Qi Stagnation.","When used to treat sores, if pus has formed, it can cause perforation, if pus has not formed, it can eliminate the sores. To stop bleeding, sprinkle the powder directly on the lesion and dress with pressure.","This herb has been shown to inhibit the growth of cancer cells.","This substance has recently been shown to increase white blood cells.","It is said that this herb, with its stinking smell, which enables it to scurry through the whole body, can activate the viscera, penetrate the channels and collaterals, reach joints and apertures and clear away Blood Stasis.","It is said to treat furuncles and carbuncles with instant results.","It is also effective in treating abdominal masses, paralysis, difficult urination and defecation and abdominal pain.","To promote lactation, use with Sm. Vaccariae #{WangBuLiuXing} Wang Bu Liu Xing.","Both Chuan Shan Jia and Spina Gleditsiae Zao Jiao Ci break up clumping and Stasis. Zao Jiao Ci is acrid and warm which gives it a strong dispersing and unblocking action. It has a sharp piercing ability to treat swollen toxic sores, especially dissolving unformed pus and promoting the healing of suppurated lesions. It is stronger that Chuan Shan Jia but does not promote lactation.","Dry-fried Pangolin Scales Chao Shan Jia are less smelly and easier to break up.","Vinegar Pangolin Scales Cu Shan Jia enter the Liver channel with an enhanced ability to disperse Stasis, unblock the collaterals and stop pain."]}
