In severe cases of coma and convulsion due to high fever, the “two horns” are often used together. This herb may substitute for Xi Jiao.","This substance has also been used to treat dysentery, erysipelas, postpartum infection and depression. Continual use was said to strengthen the bones and muscles and increase male potency.","Goat Horn, Cornu Naemorhedis Shan Yang Jiao is salty, cold, enters the Liver channel and has properties similar to this herb but is weaker. It pacifies the Liver, and treats Liver Fire or Liver Yang Rising. It can be used as a substitute in doses of 9-15 gm. It is combined with Ram. Uncariae cum Uncis #{GouTeng} Gou Teng, Rz. Gastrodiae #{TianMa} Tian Ma, Concha Haliotidis #{ShiJueMing} Shi Jue Ming, and Rz. Paridis #{ChongLou} Chong Lou, for Liver Yang Rising, with Rx. Gentianae #{LongDanCao} Long Dan Cao and Rz. Coptidis #{HuangLian} Huang Lian, for high fever with tremors and convulsions and Flos Chrysanthemi #{JuHua} Ju Hua, Fol. Mori #{SangYe} Sang Ye and Sp. Prunellae #{XiaKuCao} Xia Ku Cao, for redness and pain of the eyes due to Liver Yang Rising. It should be cooked separately for 1/2 hour before adding to the decoction.","Both this herb and Ram. cum Uncis Uncariae Gou Teng calm the Liver, extinguish Liver Wind, clear Heat and settle convulsions. They treat tremors and convulsions due to high fever or Heat in the Liver channel with Liver Yang Rising leading to headaches, dizziness and red eyes and are often used together. This herb is very effective at entering the Blood level to clear Heat and relieve toxicity with rashes or measles sinking internally. Gou Teng enters the Qi level and clears and drains Heat to treat Wind-Heat related problems such as headache and red eyes or spots and rashes failing to emerge.","Both Ling Yang Jiao and Carapax Eretmochelydis Dai Mao calm the Liver, extinguish Wind, clear Heat, resolve toxicity and treat Wind from extreme Heat with spasms, convulsions and seizures. Both can also be used to treat maculae, and rashes associated with febrile disease. Ling Yang Jiao focuses on the Liver channel with a strong ability to extinguish Wind and can also be used to clear the eyes. Dai Mao focuses on the Heart channel, opens the orifices, and calms the Spirit while also settling jitteriness and anxiety and improving impaired consciousness. It also nourishes the Liver and Kidneys to anchor the Yang."]}
