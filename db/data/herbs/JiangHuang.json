Curcumae E Zhu are warm, acrid and bitter and both break up Blood Stasis and move Qi to stop pain. E Zhu more strongly breaks up Blood Stasis and reduces accumulations while Jiang Huang moves on the Interior and Exterior to treat Wind Bi.","Both Jiang Huang and Rx. Curcumae Yu Jin promote the movement of Qi and Blood and facilitate the Gallbladder to eliminate jaundice. Yu Jin is stronger in this regard. Jiang Huang is warm rather than cold, and treats Wind Bi which Yu Jin does not do. Yu Jin enters the Blood Level to cool Heat and break up Blood Stasis while promoting the flow of Qi at the Blood Level. It also clears Heat and relieves constraint which Jiang Huang does not do."]}
