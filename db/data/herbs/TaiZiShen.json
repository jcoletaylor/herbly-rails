Ginseng #{RenShen} Ren Shen and Rx. Codonopsis #{DangShen} Dang Shen but weaker.","It is better at generating fluids.","It tonifies Spleen and Lung Qi, nourishes the Yin and generates Fluids to treat Spleen Deficiency when it is accompanied by Stomach Yin Deficiency, which often happens in the aftermath of a febrile disease.","One source says that it tonifies primal Qi of the Spleen and Lungs, stops sweating, generates Yang Fluids and settles palpitations due to Deficiency.","Tai Zi Shen, Rx. Ginseng Ren Shen, Rx. Codonopsis Dang Shen and Rx. Panacis Quinquifolii #{XiYangShen} Xi Yang Shen all tonify the primal Qi and generate Fluids. Tai Zi Shen is far weaker in effect, requiring a larger dose and its tonifying action is limited to the Lungs and Spleen. Dang Shen tonifies the Spleen Qi but not the primal Qi like Ren Shen, nor does it generate Fluids like Ren Shen and Tai Zi Shen. Xi Yang Shen is equal in strength to Ren Shen but is cooler and has a greater ability to generate Fluids. It is less appropriate when warm tonification is required. In mild cases of Qi and Yin Deficiencies, Tai Zi Shen can be substituted."]}
