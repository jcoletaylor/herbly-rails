A toxic dose is usually far above normal levels (around 15-60 gm.). Atropine and lydocaine are effective in treating overdoses.","The toxicity of this herb has been a major concern for as long as it has been used. It is usually prepared with salt, brown sugar, or bleached with water or sulfur to reduce its toxicity. One method of processing leaves the herb black called “black aconite” Hei Fu Zi, which focuses the action on the Kidneys. Another method of processing leaves the herb white called “white aconite” Bai Fu Zi, used for treating Bi pain. When the full force of this herb is required (emergency situations or topically), the untreated “fresh” form is used Sheng Fu Zi. Today, this form is rarely used.","Cornu Rhinoceri #{XiJiao} Xi Jiao, Sm. Phaseoli #{LuDou} Lu Dou, and Flos Lonicerae #{JinYinHua} Jin Yin Hua are used to reduce the toxicity of this herb.","Signs of toxic overdose include drooling, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, light-headedness, blurred vision, and numbness in the mouth and extremities. Advanced cases may show premature atrial contractions, dyspnea, tremors, incontinence, stupor, and reduced temperature and blood pressure.","The main root is #{ZhiChuanWu} Wu Tou discussed under analgesics, the branch root is Fu Zi, if there is no branch root, just the sole root, it called Tian Xiong, which is milder than Fu Zi.","Fu Zi circulates in the 12 meridians and rescues Yang Qi which has been lost. It will lead the medicine to the blood vessels which may nourish the Blood.","Upward, it nurtures the Heart, in the middle it nurtures the Stomach, and downward in strengthens the Kidney Yang.","Aconite is said to “waken the Yang,” activating the metabolism, producing Heat, removing stagnant water, tonifying the cardiac muscle and strengthening the Urinary Bladder.","Some people take the hot aspect of Fu Zi too seriously, Its effects will depend on the construction of the formula. Generally it is combined with other moisture moving herbs and thus the formula will have a heating effect. If the patient feels too hot afterwards, remove the Fu Zi.","The raw Fu Zi is quite toxic, although cooking it for a couple of hours makes it suitable for use. The processed Fu Zi is often listed as toxic but it is quite low in toxicity. Nonetheless, it is contraindicated in pregnancy and the daily dose should not exceed 10 gm. per day in strong individuals. Only processed Fu Zi should be used internally.","This herb and Rz. Zingiberis #{GanJiang} Gan Jiang treat Devastated Yang. This herb warms and tonifies Kidney and Spleen Yang, with less localized, more immediate effects, while Gan Jiang is more for the treatment of Spleen and Stomach Deficiency Cold, and has a relatively long lasting effect.","This herb and Cx. Cinnamomi Cassiae #{RouGui} Rou Gui warm and tonify the Ming Men Fire and treat Yang Deficiency Cold of the Lower Jiao, however this herb is stronger.","Radix Aconiti Preparata #{ZhiChuanWu} Zhi Chuan Wu is similar to Zhi Fu Zi but Fu Zi is best for treating Cold and can be used with tonifying herbs while Chuan Wu is best for treating Wind and its drying nature is excessive and not appropriate to use with tonics. Radix Aconiti Kusnezoffii Preparata #{ZhiCaoWu} Zhi Cao Wu is collected in the wild and treats severe Wind and stubborn Bi.","Both Zhi Fu Zi and Cx. Cinnamomi Rou Gui are acrid, warm and move into the Lower Jiao to tonify Kidney Yang, augment Ming Men Fire, disperse Cold and treat Cold-Damp Bi. Fu Zi enters all twelve channels and assists the Du channel. It is used in cases of Devastated Yang. Rou Gui concentrates on the Heart, Spleen, Liver and Kidney channels and is not used in cases of Devastated Yang.","Zhi Fu Zi, Cervi Cornu Pantotrichum #{LuRong} Lu Rong and Cx. Cinnamomi Rou Gui all warm the Kidneys and fortify Yang. Zhi Fu Zi and Rou Gui are both acrid, harsh, hot and drying with a strong, rapid effect of warming the Interior, expelling Cold, and assist in tonifying Yang. Lu Rong is sweet, warm, soft and moistening with a gradual effect that tonifies Yang while moistening Jing and Blood. They all treat Kidney Yang Deficiency, however Fu Zi and Rou Gui are only suitable for Kidney Yang Deficiency with Excess Internal Cold and are inappropriate if Jing or Blood is deficient. Lu Rong is not suited for expelling Internal Cold, but is most appropriate for Yang Deficiency with Jing, Blood and marrow insufficiency.","Baked Aconite Accessory Root Bao Fu Zi is slightly less toxic and primarily warms the Spleen and Kidneys. It is used for Cold pain in the epigastrium and abdomen, nausea and diarrhea due to Deficiency Cold.","Bland Aconite Accessory Root Dan Fu Zi no longer numbs the tongue, is much less toxic and is the standard form for rescuing Yang, dispersing Cold, warming and unblocking the channels and collaterals and tonifying Ming Men Fire. Safe dosage is 3-15g."]}
