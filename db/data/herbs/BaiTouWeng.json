Bruceae #{YaDanZi} Ya Dan Zi and Hb. Portulacae #{MaChiXian} Ma Chi Xian all clear Heat, resolve toxicity and treat dysenteric disorders. They are used together to treat bleeding dysenteric disorders due to Heat toxin. Ma Chi Xian primarily treats red dysenteric disorders with mucus and Blood, partly because it cools the Blood and stops bleeding. Ya Dan Zi primarily treats dysenteric disorders that alternate between mild and severe, or seem to be cured and then recur. Bai Tou Weng treats both types."]}
