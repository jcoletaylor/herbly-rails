Inulae Jin Fei Cao is the aerial part of the same plant. It is salty, slightly bitter and warm and transforms Phlegm and stops coughs. It is for more superficial problems than Xuan Fu Hua.","It is primarily used for reflux of Stomach Qi.","This herb descends rebellious Qi, disperses Phlegm, transforms thin mucus, dispels epigastric obstruction, harmonizes the Stomach, alleviates nausea and drains the Lungs.","Wrap this herb in cheese cloth before drinking to avoid ingesting the thorn in the flower.","Both Xuan Fu Hua and Rz. Pinelliae Preparatum #{ZhiBanXia} Zhi Ban Xia disperse clumped Phlegm, settle the Stomach and stop vomiting. Zhi Ban Xia primarily dries Dampness to transform Phlegm and is best to treat profuse, thin, clear Phlegm that is easy to cough up. Xuan Fu Hua descends rebellious Qi, breaks up clumped accumulation, promotes the movement of pathogenic water and is more appropriate for thick, viscous, hard-to-expectorate Phlegm or flank pain with distention and a sensation of fullness in the chest and abdomen from accumulated water and thin mucus or Middle Jiao Qi Deficiency allowing water and Dampness to build up in the Spleen and Stomach causing nausea.","#{FuHaiShi} Both Xuan Fu Hua and Pumex #{FuShi} Fu Shi are salty and thus able to soften hardened Phlegm. They are often combined to treat clumped viscous sputum that is difficult to expectorate. Xuan Fu Hua is warm, bitter and acrid to guide Qi downward in the treatment of cough, wheezing and nausea. Fu Hai Shi is cold and better for hot viscous Phlegm or Lung Heat injuring the collaterals leading to hemoptysis.","Both Xuan Fu Hua and Haematitum #{DaiZheShi} Dai Zhe Shi descend rebellious Lung and Stomach Qi to stop nausea, vomiting and wheezing. It also sedates the Liver Yang, cools the Blood and stops bleeding. Dai Zhe Shi uses its heaviness to sink rebellious Qi and its bitter Coldness to cool Liver Fire. Xuan Fu Hua uses its saltiness to soften hardened areas of clumped Phlegm, which are then dispersed by its warm acridity and descended by its bitterness. It is most appropriate when clumped Phlegm obstructs the ascending and descending flow of Qi, leading to nausea, vomiting and wheezing.","Honey-prepared Inula Flower Mi Zhi Xuan Fu Hua Is less acrid and bitter and not as warm, drying or descending to allow the herbs to descend Qi without injuring it and to descend Phlegm with out injuring the Yin. It is good for patients with Lung Qi or Yin Deficiency with cough, wheezing and Phlegm or thin mucus.","Inula Stalks Xuan Fu Geng have an action similar to the flowers and are mainly used for cough, wheezing and rebellious Qi due to Cold-Phlegm obstruction as well as nausea, vomiting and belching due to Internal pathogenic water and Dampness.","It is said that Xuan Fu Hua and Rz. Cyperi #{XiangFu} Xiang Fu are best for right-sided hypochondriac pain and Fr. Toosendan #{ChuanLianZi} Chuan Lian Zi and Rz. Corydalis #{YanHuSuo} Yan Hu Suo are best for left-sided hypochondriac pain."]}
