for headaches.","This herb governs head Wind, headache, dizziness, vertigo, epilepsy with strong convulsions, spasms in the four limbs, difficult speech and all Wind-stroke and Wind-Phlegm conditions.","This herb is traditionally believed to sharpen memory and promote strength.","It would be more used if it were less expensive. New cultivation techniques are helping to bring the cost down.","Some sources say that this herb disperses Wind-Damp Bi, stabilizes fright and moistens Liver Blood.","This herb is capable of promoting circulation in the cerebral and coronary arteries.","The principle treatment for Liver Wind is to nourish and move Blood.","Tian Ma and Ram. cum Uncis Uncariae #{GouTeng} Gou Teng are similar. Both calm the Liver and extinguish Wind to treat dizziness, vertigo and headache and are often used together. Gou Teng is sweet and Cold and treats Heat-induced Wind while Tian Ma is sweet warm and dry and treats Wind-Cold with Phlegm Dampness."]}
