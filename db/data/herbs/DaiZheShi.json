It also sedates the Liver Yang, cools the Blood and stops bleeding. Dai Zhe Shi uses its heaviness to sink rebellious Qi and its bitter Coldness to cool Liver Fire. Xuan Fu Hua uses its saltiness to soften hardened areas of clumped Phlegm, which are then dispersed by its warm acridity and descended by its bitterness. It is most appropriate when clumped Phlegm obstructs the ascending and descending flow of Qi, leading to nausea, vomiting and wheezing.","Both Dai Zhe Shi and Lapis Chloriti #{QingMengShi} Qing Meng Shi are heavy metal with a sinking nature, both pacify the Liver, sedate convulsions, descend rebellious Qi and scour out Phlegm. Dai Zhe Shi is bitter, sweet and neutral. It mobilizes Qi pathways, enters the Blood level and is very effective at suppressing rebellious Qi in the Chong channel, extinguishing Liver Wind, cooling the Blood and stopping bleeding. It is valued for sedating the Liver and descending rebellious Qi. Qing Meng Shi is more intense. It is salty and specifically mobilizes the digestive tract, clearing Phlegm and Food Stagnation. By removing the source of Food Stagnation, it can clear the Lungs, Liver and Stomach.","Both Dai Zhe and Magnetitum #{CiShi} Shi #{CiShi} Ci Shi are heavy substances that anchor the Yang, sedate fright and quiet the Spirit. Ci Shi protects the True Yin and is best used when the True Yin is deficient in the lower body, allowing Yang to float up. Dai Zhe Shi suppresses and descends Qi to clear and descend Liver Fire. It is used for treating Liver Yang rising, with dizziness, headaches and tinnitus, to sedate fright and to stop nausea, vomiting and wheezing. It also cools the Liver Blood to stop bleeding.","Calcined Hematite Duan Dai Zhe Shi is less cold and bitter and better able to restrain, inhibit and stop bleeding. It is most often used to treat epistaxis, hematemesis and continuous uterine bleeding."]}
