Sophorae Huai Jiao is bitter, cold, and enters the Liver and Large Intestine. It is less effective than Huai Hua at stopping bleeding and stronger at sedating Heat. It also lubricates the Intestines. It treats hemorrhoidal bleeding, hematochezia, or bleeding due to abscesses or swelling and pain. It is contraindicated in pregnancy or for those with Spleen and Stomach Deficiency Cold. The dosage is 10-15g."]}
