Ephedrae #{MaHuang} Ma Huang. It can substitute for Ma Huang with weaker patients.","Some sources say that this herb Moistens the Lungs and treats cough due to Wind-Cold.","This herb is excellent for treating Qi gathered in the throat with audible Phlegm. Taken with wine it treats chronic coughing that prevents sleep with the rattling sound of Phlegm in the throat and ascending Qi rushing up to the throat, threatening to stop breathing.","Both Bai Qian and Rx. Peucedani #{QianHu} Qian Hu excel at descending rebellious Qi, reducing profuse Phlegm and are used for coughing with profuse Phlegm due to External Wind-Heat. Bai Qian is slightly warm and is best for accumulated Obstruction of Lung Qi leading to profuse Phlegm, rattling in the throat a stifling fullness in the chest and acute wheezing. Qian Hu cools Heat, releases the Exterior, disperses clumps and disperses Wind to treat coughing with thick, yellow Phlegm with Exterior Wind-Heat. These two herbs are used together so frequently, they are referred to as \"the two Qian\".","Both Bai Qian and Fol. Eriobotryae #{PiPaYe} Pi Pa Ye are good at descending rebellious Lung Qi. Pi Pa Ye is cooling and moistening, and best for treating dry cough or hard-to-expectorate Phlegm. It also stops nausea. Bai Qian is warming and parching and is best for External Pathogenic Qi which has obstructed the Lungs causing a sensation of fullness in the chest and the sound of Phlegm in the throat.","Tender Cynanchum Nen Bai Qian is of superior quality, has more power to descend Qi and transform Phlegm, but tends to exhaust Qi and injure the Spleen.","Dry-fried Cynanchum Chao Bai Qian has slightly ameliorated acrid, dispersing properties and thereby protects the Spleen, and is indicated for chronic cough from Lung Deficiency with profuse Phlegm and rebellious Qi.","Honey-prepared Cynanchum Mi Zhi Bai Qian moistens the Lungs and thus no longer injures the Qi or Yin. It also retains its ability to descend Qi and transform Phlegm to treat dry cough due to Lung Yin Deficiency and is the most appropriate preparation for patients with Spleen and Stomach weakness.","This herb is proving very successful at treating hives as well as other type I allergic conditions."]}
