Amomi Rotundus #{BaiDouKou} Bai Dou Kou have similar flavors and properties.

It also calms the fetus. Bai Dou Kou unblocks and disseminates Lung Qi and has a clear, fragrant aroma that is less drying than Sha Ren. and is primarily used for Phlegm-Dampness obstructing the Lungs with a stifling sensation in the chest and for mild cases of Cold-Dampness lurking and constrained in the Middle Jiao.","When comparing Sha Ren, Fr.

For warming and drying; Sha Ren is weakest, Bai Dou Kou is stronger, Cao Dou Kou is third strongest and Cao Guo is the strongest.","Salt-prepared Amomum Fruit Yan Sha Ren is less warm and acrid, to warm without drying with an enhanced ability to descend Qi and calm the fetus. It can guide other herbs downward, warm the Kidneys, inhibit urination and can be used for morning sickness, restless fetus, frequent urination and urinary incontinence.","Amomum Husk Sha Ren Ke (Pericarpium Amomi Sha Ren Qiao) is similar to Sha Ren, but not as strong or as warm and is used to treat patients with Spleen Deficiency who require gentler treatment. It is also used for milder conditions. The dosage is 3-4.5g.","The seeds alone Guang Sha Ren are somewhat stronger with a dosage of 2-5g."]}
