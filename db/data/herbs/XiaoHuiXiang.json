Zingiberis Officinalis #{GanJiang} Gan Jiang for Cold in the Liver Channel.","This herb is used for dispelling abdominal Cold that produces distention, pain and digestive disturbance. It is also a reproductive tonic.","It can be heated and applied topically to the scrotum and abdomen for cold hernial disorders.","This is the common spice used in cooking.","Both Xiao Hui Xiang and Rx. Linderae #{WuYao} Wu Yao are acrid, warm and aromatic. Wu Yao disseminates and unblocks the Qi, mobilizes the Spleen and Lungs and pervades the Liver, Kidneys and Bladder. It smooths and descends Qi, disperses Cold and alleviates pain by dredging and unblocking rebellious Qi in the chest and abdomen. Xiao Hui Xiang does not reach the upper Jiao, but addresses the Middle and Lower Jiaos. It descends Qi to settle nausea, disperse Cold and alleviate abdominal pain, but is particularly noted for its ability to treat bulging disorders.","Both Xiao Hui Xiang and Sm. Trigonellae #{HuLuBa} Hu Lu Ba are aromatic, warm, expel Lower Jiao Cold and treat bulging disorders and are often used together. Xiao Hui Xiang enters the Middle Jiao to enhance appetite, settle nausea and alleviate abdominal pain and distention and enters the Lower Jiao to warm and treat all types of bulging disorders. It can be excessively drying in large doses. Hu Lu Ba is limited to the Lower Jiao and is basically a strongly warming Yang tonic with a mild aroma that drives out lurking Cold Qi accumulated in the Lower Jiao.","Dried Fennel Chao Hui Xiang is not as strong at mobilizing, but is stronger at warming and adjusting the Middle and awakening the Spleen. It is often used to treat nausea and vomiting due to Stomach Cold or anorexia due to Spleen Deficiency.","Salt-fried Fennel Yan Hui Xiang is stronger at descending into the Kidneys to warm and disperse pathogenic Cold in the Lower Jiao."]}
