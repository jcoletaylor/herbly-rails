Ci Shi protects the True Yin and is best used when the True Yin is deficient in the lower body, allowing Yang to float up. Dai Zhe Shi suppresses and descends Qi to clear and descend Liver Fire. It is used for treating Liver Yang rising, with dizziness, headaches and tinnitus, to sedate fright and to stop nausea, vomiting and wheezing. It also cools the Liver Blood to stop bleeding.","Calcined Magnetite Duan Ci Shi is easier to pulverize and is stronger at tonifying the Kidneys, grasping Qi and improving hearing and vision.
