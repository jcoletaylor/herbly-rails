It may lead to dyspnea, dilated pupils, arrhythmias and coma. Cooking, removing the cover and mixing with sugar reduces its toxicity. The bark of the apricot or the cortex of its root are used as antidotes.","This herb is in expectorant formulas - especially for Lung Cold.","This herb inhibits the growth of cancer cells.","Powdered, it can completely inhibit the growth of strong carcinogenic fungi.","This herb can be used for intestinal cancer.","It is good for externally contracted coughs.","It has a descending function and is therefore good to stop coughing and wheezing.","Some sources say that this herb relieves muscle tension.","It relieves pathogenic factors from the muscles and skin, drives out Wind, descends Qi, eliminates Dryness and relieves Qi Stagnation.","Because of its toxicity, it is used to treat sores and kill parasites.","Xing Ren unblocks the collaterals of the Lungs, is soft and presses down internally. Rx. Ephedrae #{MaHuang} Ma Huang opens pores and interstices, is hard and expands the exterior. Used together, they completely eradicate the pathogen.","Both Xing Ren and Sm. Persicae #{TaoRen} Tao Ren are good for constipation caused by either Qi or Blood Stagnation. Xing Ren cures asthma because of it circulates Qi and Sm. Persicae Tao Ren cures mania because it invigorates the Blood.","Xing Ren and Per. Citri Reticulate #{ChenPi} Chen Pi, are used together for deficient patients who cannot tolerate strong purgation.","Sm. Armeniacae Amrum Ku Xing Ren (bitter or northern Apricot Kernel) are the most used type. The outer coating is toxic and must be removed.","Sm. Armeniacae Dulce Tian Xing Ren (sweet or southern Apricot Kernel) is used for dry or deficient coughs. They are less toxic, more moistening and are used for cough and wheezing. The actions are more gradual and less pronounced than Ku Xing Ren. These kernels are also used for food.","Dry-fried Apricot Kernel Chao Xing Ren is more appropriate for patients with a weak Spleen and Stomach and a tendency toward loose stools. They still alleviate cough and wheezing.","Defatted Apricot Kernel Xing Ren Shuang has no Intestinal moistening properties but still transforms Phlegm and eliminates cough and may have Blood-invigorating and collateral-opening properties."]}
