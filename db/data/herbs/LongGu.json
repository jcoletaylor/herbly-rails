Cool, and have basically the same functions as Long Gu, however the “teeth” are especially effective for palpitations with anxiety, insomnia, dream-disturbed sleep, convulsions and delirium. It is also used to treat arthritis, osteomyelitis and gastralgia. The dosage is 9-16g. For restlessness or night crying in children, use with Rx. Paeoniae Alba #{BaiShao} Bai Shao, Rx. Ophiopogonis #{MaiMenDong} Mai Men Dong, Rx. et Rz. Rhei #{DaHuang} Da Huang and Rz. Cimicifugae #{ShengMa} Sheng Ma.","This herb is a mineral not an animal part. It is the fossilized remains of various animals which are rich in a variety of calcium salts and other minerals.","It can be used alone topically for non-healing sores, ulcers eczema or rashes.","Some sources say that this herb settles fright and stabilizes Liver Wind.","This herb treats disorders of the Dai channel.","Both this herb and Concha Ostreae #{MuLi} Mu Li have astringent properties. Mu Li also softens hardness and dissipates nodules, while Long Gu is better at calming the Spirit. They are often used together to enhance their ability to subdue Rising Yang.","Both Long Gu and Concha Ostreae Mu Li are similar in many of their qualities and are often used together. Long Gu is sweet, astringent enters the Heart and Liver channels and is better at stopping abandonment, suppressing fright calming the Spirit. It does not soften hardness or disperse clumping and has much less Yin -nourishing ability so is less used when Yin Deficiency causes night sweats. Mu Li is salty, astringent, enters the Kidneys to soften hardness, transform Phlegm and cool Heat.","Calcined Dragon bone Duan Long Gu has an enhanced ability to restrain, inhibit and bind to stop sweating, astringe Jing, stop bleeding, bind up the Intestines and generate flesh. It is primarily used to treat night sweats, spontaneous sweating, spermatorrhea, vaginal discharge, continuous uterine bleeding, chronic diarrhea or dysenteric disorder and is applied externally to assist the closure of non-healing sores."]}
