this herb is greasy, aids dampness, generates Heat and readily induces fullness in the middle Jiao see contraindications.","Because its effect is moderate and slow, it can be taken long term.","It is most often used for treatment of debility and recovery from chronic diseases such as bronchitis and cardiac weakness.","This is not a strong tonic and must be combined with other herbs to guide it actions.","With Qi tonics, it tonifies the Qi., with Yin tonics, it tonifies the Yin, with Spleen and Stomach tonics, it tonifies the Middle Jiao, with Lung tonics, it moistens the Lungs, and with Kidney tonics, it augments Jing.","It can be consumed as a food.","One source says that it reinforces the sinews and bones, alleviates hunger, increases resistance to extremes in temperature, augments the Spleen and Stomach and moistens the Heart and Lungs.","This herb is commonly used in convalescence after chronic illness or for Lung Yin Deficiency or Lung Dryness.","It is routinely included in prescriptions for coronary or other circulatory disorders.","Both Huang Jing and Rz. Dioscoreae #{ShanYao} Shan Yao are sweet, tonify the Qi, nourish the Yin and are often used to treat Lung, Kidney and Spleen Deficiency. Huang Jing is moist and more strongly nourishes the Yin, while Shan Yao astringes and is therefore appropriate where Qi and Yin Deficiency involve loss as in diarrhea, vaginal discharge or spermatorrhea.","Both Huang Jing and Rz. Polygonati Odorati #{YuZhu} Yu Zhu nourish the Lungs and Stomach. Huang Jing is stronger at tonifying Kidney Yin. Yu Zhu is stronger at tonifying Stomach Yin.","Cooked Polygonatum Shu Huang Jing is a stronger tonic and is less irritating to the throat.","Wine-prepared Polygonatum Jiu Huang Jing is a stronger tonic, is less cloying and is better for treating weakness of the knees and joint pain."]}
