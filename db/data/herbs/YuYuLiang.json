Yu Yu Liang is heavier than Chi Shi Zhi, and astringes the lower Jiao, without tonifying or augmenting the Stomach, while Chi Shi Zhi being sweet and warm, augments the Qi, generates flesh, and adjusts the Middle. It is more appropriate for sores that fail to heal due to Qi Deficiency, and diarrhea or uterine bleeding disorders due to inability to securely store. Ying Su Ke is light in weight and slightly cold. It enters the Qi level and preserves the Lungs.","Calcined Limonite Duan Yu Yu Liang is better able to astringe."]}
