Zhi Ke governs the upper trunk, including disorders of the chest, diaphragm, skin and body hair while Zhi Shi governs the lower trunk, including disorders of the Heart, abdomen, Spleen and Stomach. Its nature is violent and excels at thrusting downward, while Zhi Ke is gentler and slower in promoting the movement of Qi through the chest, diaphragm, Lungs, Stomach and Large Intestine.","Dry-fried Bitter Orange Chao Zhi Ke is more moderate than unprepared Bitter Orange Zhi Ke. and is more appropriate for elderly or weak patients or for inclusion in tonifying formulas to aid digestion.","Charred Bitter Orange Zhi Ke Tan is much less cold and enters the Blood level to stop bleeding. It is also used for Qi blockage disorders associated with bleeding such as Intestinal Wind."]}
