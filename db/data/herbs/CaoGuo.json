Roasting or dry-frying with ginger juice reduces this side effect.","Tsaoko kernels Cao Guo Ren are extremely aromatic and drying and are good for drying Dampness and dispersing Cold. They are used to treat alternating chills and fever and chills that occur in the early stage of malarial disorders and other epidemic disorders when accompanied by turbid Dampness.","When comparing Cao Guo, Fr. Amomi #{ShaRen} Sha Ren, Fr. Amomi Rotundus #{BaiDouKou} Bai Dou Kou and Sm. Alpiniae Katsumadai #{CaoDouKou} Cao Dou Kou, for promoting the Qi; Sha Ren is strongest, Bai Dou Kou is second strongest, Cao Dou Kou is third and Cao Guo has almost no effect. For warming and drying; Sha Ren is weakest, Bai Dou Kou is stronger, Cao Dou Kou is third strongest and Cao Guo is the strongest.","Both Cao Guo and Sm. Myristicae Rou Dou Kou expel Cold, Dry Dampness, and promote the movement of Qi to regulate the Spleen and Stomach. They are both acrid, however Rou Dou Kou's astringent flavor is greater and it can stabilize leakage and loss from the Large Intestine. It warms the Spleen and Kidneys and therefore treats the Middle and Lower Jiaos, while Cao Guo specifically governs the Middle Jiao.","Ginger-prepared Tsaoko Seeds Jiang Cao Guo Zi are less drying and are more able to warm the Stomach and alleviate nausea. They are used to treat Cold-Dampness Obstructing the Spleen and Stomach with epigastric and abdominal distention and fullness and pain."]}
