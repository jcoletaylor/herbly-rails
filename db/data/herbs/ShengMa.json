Puerariae Ge Gen and Rx. Bupleuri #{ChaiHu} Chai Hu all release the exterior and raise Yang. Sheng Ma disperses Wind in the muscle layer and exterior, stops Yang Ming headache, and is ideal for raising Spleen and Stomach Yang Qi to treat sinking of Yang Qi with chronic diarrhea or prolapse. Ge Gen focuses on the Yang Ming channel to release the muscle layer, eliminate Heat and treat stiff neck while encouraging the Stomach Qi to rise, producing Fluids and stopping thirst. Baked, it can lift the Yang and stop diarrhea. Chai Hu focuses on dispersing Xiao Yang channel pathogens to treat alternating chills and fever and raises Yang Qi. Its lifting power is weaker than that of Sheng ma, so they are often used together. Ge Gen and Sheng Ma can both vent rashes and Sheng Ma and Chai Hu both spread Liver Qi.","Unprepared Cimicifuga Sheng Sheng Ma releases the exterior, vents rashes and strongly cools and relieves toxicity.","Honey-prepared Cimicifuga Mi Zhi Sheng Ma is less acrid and dispersing, but targets the Middle Jiao and has a stronger ascending tendency.","Charred Cimicifuga Sheng Ma Tan is less acrid and dispersing, but is able to stop bleeding for vaginal or rectal bleeding from weak Spleen or Qi Deficiency.","Dry-fried Cimicifuga Chao Sheng Ma when fried in vinegar, has a remarkable ability to treat dysenteric disorders with nausea and difficulty eating when combined with Rx. Ginseng #{RenShen} Ren Shen and Sm. Nelumbinis #{LianZi} Lian Zi. When fried in wine, its abilities to tonify the Spleen and ascend are increased. Frying it in salt leads it to the Kidney channel to lift and benefit the Kidney Qi. It can be used for treating spermatorrhea, vaginal discharge and incontinence when fried in salt and combined with Kidney tonics."]}
