Jujube #{DaZao} Da Zao, and Rz. Atractylodis Macrocephalae #{BaiZhu} Bai Zhu tonify Qi. Bai Zhu is drying and does not moisten. Shan Yao is neutral and tonifies Spleen Yin while Da Zao tonifies both Qi and Blood in the Spleen and Stomach.","Both Shan Yao and Sm. Nelumbinis #{LianZi} Lian Zi are sweet, neutral, astringent, enter and strengthen the Spleen and Kidneys and astringe the Intestines and Lower Jiao. They are often combined to treat diarrhea due to Spleen or Kidney Deficiency leading to spermatorrhea, enuresis or vaginal discharge. Shan Yao enters the Lung channel to tonify Lung Yin, stopping coughs due to Deficiency consumption. It is primarily a tonic, augmenting both Qi and Yin of the Lungs, Spleen and Kidneys. Lian Zi also nourishes the Heart, calms the Spirit, stops bleeding and is often used to reestablish communication between the Heart and Kidneys which has led to palpitations, insomnia, spermatorrhea, deficient irritability, wasting and thirsting disorder and bleeding disorders such as hematuria or incessant uterine bleeding.","Dry-fried Dioscoreae Chao Shan Yao more strongly augments the Spleen, harmonizes the Stomach and tonifies the Kidneys to astringe Jing. It is used to stop diarrhea, loose stools, vaginal discharge and spermatorrhea.","Earth-fried Dioscoreae Tu Chao Shan Yao is good for tonifying the Spleen and harmonizing the Stomach and is most often used for cases of weak Spleen with anorexia, fatigue and diarrhea, but is equally suitable for vaginal discharge."]}
