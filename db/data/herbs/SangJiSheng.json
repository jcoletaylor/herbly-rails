Dipsaci #{XuDuan} Xu Duan have the same therapeutic action but they are different in nature and flavor. They can be used together or if one is unavailable the other can be substituted for it. They both tonify the Liver and Kidneys, strengthen the sinews and bones and augment Blood to calm the fetus. Sang Ji Sheng expels Wind-Dampness and is more appropriate when the pain in the lower back, sinews and bones is due to liver and Kidney Deficiency with Wind-Damp Bi. Xu Duan disseminates and unblocks all channels and excels at connecting the sinews and bones.","Both Sang Ji Sheng and Cx. Acanthopanacis #{WuJiaPi} Wu Jia Pi dispel wind-dampness, tonify the Liver and Kidneys and strengthen the sinews and bones. Sang Ji Sheng is neutral, more moistening, and milder in its ability to expel Wind- Dampness. It tonifies the Blood rather than the Yang of the Liver and Kidneys and is best at restoring Blood nourishment to the joints affected by Wind, Cold and Dampness. Wu Jia Pi is acrid, bitter and warm and primarily drives out pathogens. it also warms the Yang of the Liver and Kidneys.","Both Sang Ji Sheng and Cx. Eucommiae #{DuZhong} Du Zhong treat low back pain. Dispels Wind-Damp and tonifies Blood to treat pain. Du Zhong tonifies Qi and strengthens soft tissue to relieve pain. They are often used together."]}
