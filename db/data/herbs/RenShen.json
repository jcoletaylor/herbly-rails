sources say that this herb tonifies Wei Qi.","Because it strongly tonifies Yuan Qi, this herb is used in a wide variety of situations where a stronger Yuan Qi, will indirectly aid in their resolution.","This herb can be used alone for collapse of Yuan Qi.","This herb has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on the growth of cancer cells.","Although Ren Shen antagonizes Faeces Trogopterori #{WuLingZhi} Wu Ling Zhi, the two used together may be beneficial in the treatment of cancer.","It is said that this herb relieves thirst, upset, activates the channels and pulse, removes Phlegm Stagnation and stops vomiting, cough and diseases due to Qi and Blood Deficiency.","Its anti-cancer effect is stronger when used with Rx. Astragali #{HuangQi} Huang Qi and Ganoderma #{LingZhi} Ling Zhi.","For chaotic bleeding of the nose and mouth, burn to ashes Ren Shen, Cacumen Biotae #{CeBaiYe} Ce Bai Ye and Hb. Schizonepetae #{JingJie} Jing Jie and sprinkle them on the face of the patient.","Both Ren Shen and Rx. Astragali Huang Qi tonify primal Qi. Huang Qi also supports the Yang and is most appropriate for disorders that involve sinking of clear Qi. It also stops sweating, promotes the discharge of pus, generates flesh and facilitates urination, none of which Ren Shen can do. Ren Shen also generates fluids and its tonic effect is stronger and longer lasting than Huang Qi.","Both Ren Shen and Rx. Codonopsis #{DangShen} Dang Shen have similar properties and functions. Ren Shen is much broader in its effects and must be used when the disorder is severe or requires immediate relief as in patterns of abandonment or profuse bleeding. Dang Shen tonifies Qi and indirectly augments Blood and Fluids, but does not tonify Yuan Qi or directly generate Fluids. Its effects are limited to the Spleen and Lungs and is less powerful than Ren Shen, although it is sufficient for everyday clinical use and is therefore a good substitute for Ren Shen when a Deficiency pattern is not severe. It is often used as an inexpensive substitute for Ren Shen.","Both Ren Shen and Rx. Panacis Quinquifolii #{XiYangShen} Xi Yang Shen tonify Qi. Xi Yang Shen is sweet, slightly bitter and cooling. It also tonifies and augments the Blood aspect. It can be used to substitute for Ren Shen whenever one wants to tonify Qi without warming.","Ren Shen governs tonification of the five organs, quiets the consciousness, settles the ethereal and corporeal souls, stops palpitations with anxiety, expels pathogenic Qi, brightens the eyes, opens the Heart and strengthens resolve.","Ginseng Neck Ren Shen Lu is a mild emetic and is used to induce vomiting when there is an absence of Food Stagnation and Phlegm along with Deficiency.","Ginseng Leaf Ren Shen Ye is bitter, slightly sweet and cold. it treats Summerheat with thirst, injury to fluids due to febrile disease, hoarseness associated with Lung Heat, insufficient Stomach Yin, toothache due to Deficiency and alcohol intoxication.","Ginseng Rootlets Shen Xu, are generally used for depletion of Qi and damage to the Body Fluids.","Jilin root Ye Shan Shen or Shan Shen is the best quality.","“White Ginseng ” Bai Shen or “sugar root” Tang Shen is cured in rock candy for treating Yin Deficiency.","“Fresh-dried Ginseng” Sheng Shai Shen is also used for Yin Deficiency.","Steaming turns roots red Hong Shen and makes them hotter - for Qi and Yang Deficiency e.g. Korean Ginseng."]}
