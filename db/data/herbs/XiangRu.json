Pogostemonis/Agastaches #{HuoXiang} Huo Xiang are both used in treating Summer Heat, diarrhea, bloating etc. Huo Xiang is more for harmonizing the Middle while Xiang Ru is more for relieving the surface.","Some sources say that this herb is an astringent, stops diarrhea and moves Qi.","This herb is primarily for Cold damage in the Heat of summer, either by too much cold food and drink or by seeking shelter in overly air-conditioned spaces. It also treats Yin-type summerheat which is the combined exposure to external Cold with over-consumption of cold food and drinks leading to fever without sweating, headaches, vomiting and diarrhea.","It has the ability to ascend or descend with equal strength to make clear Qi rise up and turbid filth descend.","It should be taken in small doses.","Other symptoms that should be treated by Xiang Ru are steamy hot skin, aversion to Cold, headache, a heavy head, spontaneous sweating, restless thirst and possibly abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. If there is already sweating, it must be used with caution.","Xiang Ru is sometimes called the \"Rx. Ephedrae #{MaHuang} M#{MaHuang} a Huang of summer\" because it is acrid, warm, and induces sweating for Wind-Cold invasion and facilitates the flow of urine. Xiang Ru helps the Yang Qi throw off the pathogenic Cold which traps it within while harmonizing the Spleen and transforming Dampness. Ma Huang disperses and disseminates Lung Qi to alleviate cough, Its sweat-inducing and Cold-dispersing properties are stronger and it directly vents the exterior through sweating rather than assisting the Yang Qi to throw off or discharge the pathogenic Cold."]}
