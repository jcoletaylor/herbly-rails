Long-term use will cure hypochondriac mass in males and abdominal mass in females.","One source says that it strengthens muscles and bones.","Another source says it generates flesh and is effective for ulcers.","Both Ji Nei Jing and Fr. Crataegi #{ShanZha} Shan Zha strongly reduce Food Stagnation. Shan Zha reduces accumulated blockage due to over consumption of meat, moving Qi and breaking up Blood Stasis and is used for amenorrhea, bulging disorders, and chest pain due to obstructive Stagnation, while Ji Nei Jing treats all types of Food Stagnation, strengthens the Stomach, stops enuresis and dissolves stones.","Ji Ne Jing, Shan Zha and #{LaiFuZi} Lai Fu Zi all dissolve Food Stagnation and promote digestion.

Shan Zha has recently been used to lower cholesterol and treat cardiac disorders and Lai Fu Zi is stronger for relief of abdominal fullness and distention. It also dissolves Phlegm and relieves cough and dyspnea.","Unprepared Gizzard Lining Sheng Ji Nei Jin is most appropriate for treating biliary or urinary tract stones.","Dry-fried gizzard Lining Chao Ji Nei Jin has a less unpleasant odor, is better at unbinding the Stomach and reducing Food Stagnation.

It can be applied topically for skin diseases and mouth ulcers."]}
