It is used for Yin deficiency patients.","This herb is primarily used for Stagnation of Qi in the Spleen/Stomach.","This herb is used for stagnant Qi that is hot in nature.","This herb is also appropriate for Stagnation in the chest and upper back.","Using a moderate dosage, this herb can treat allergies.","Both Zhi Shi and Fr. Aurantii Zhi Ke are the same fruit at different stages of development. Zhi Shi is unripe and Zhi Ke is almost ripe. Both break up Qi , disperse clumps and Phlegm and reduce focal distention. Zhi Ke governs the upper trunk, including disorders of the chest, diaphragm, skin and body hair while Zhi Shi governs the lower trunk, including disorders of the Heart, abdomen, Spleen and Stomach. Its nature is violent and excels at thrusting downward, while Zhi Ke is gentler and slower in promoting the movement of Qi through the chest, diaphragm, Lungs, Stomach and Large Intestine.","Dry-fried unripe Bitter Orange Chao Zhi Shi is slightly warmer and not so strong in nature and can be used in both Hot and Cold disorders.","Dry-fried Goose-Eyed Unripe Bitter Orange Chao E Yan Zhi Shi is slightly stronger than Chao Zhi Shi.","Charred Unripe Bitter orange Zhi Shi Tan is slightly less cold and enters the Blood level to stop bleeding and is often used for Qi Blockage associated with bleeding such as Intestinal Wind."]}
