Tsaoko #{CaoGuo} Cao Guo expel Cold, Dry Dampness, and promote the movement of Qi to regulate the Spleen and Stomach. They are both acrid, however Rou Dou Kou's astringent flavor is greater and it can stabilize leakage and loss from the Large Intestine. It warms the Spleen and Kidneys and therefore treats the Middle and Lower Jiaos, while Cao Guo specifically governs the Middle Jiao.","Roasted Nutmeg Seeds Wei Rou Dou Kou has a reduced potential for irritating the Intestines and a reduced amount of hallucinogenic myristicin. Its astringent property is enhanced to stop diarrhea."]}
