It also dries Dampness and therefore is appropriate for treating vaginal discharge.","Aged Trachycarpus Chen Zong Pi are traditionally the only fiber used.for medicinal purposes. The older and more used, the better effect.","Charred Trachycarpus Chen Zong (Zong Lu Tan, Zong Pi Tan) enters the Blood, stopping all types of bleeding and can be used for epistaxis, hematemesis, Intestinal Wind, and continuous uterine bleeding whenever there is no Heat internally. This is the most commonly used form. It is most appropriate when bleeding is heavy as long as the Stasis and obstruction have already been completely eliminated.","Fructus Trachycarpi Zong Lu Zi is the fruit of the same plant and has similar functions and indications. Zong Lu Zi is more effective in treating hypertension, insomnia or excessive dreaming. the dosage is 6-30g."]}
