Chuan Yu Jin is milder, is more for moving Qi, and is used for weaker patients. Guang Yu Jin is stronger and is more for moving Blood.","This herb also helps relieve depression.","This herb is quite valuable for its Liver dredging and Gallbladder purging abilities. It is similar to Rx. Bupleuri #{ChaiHu} Chai Hu. It also treats sharp pain (similar to Corydalis #{YanHuSuo} Yan Hu Suo and Melia #{KuLianPi} Ku Lian Gen Pi).","This herb is similar in action to Rz. Curcumae Longae #{JiangHuang} Jiang Huang and Rz. Curcumae #{EZhu} E Zhu.","This herb is good for Heat in the Blood with Stasis.","Although its ability to clear the Heart is good, its ability to open the Orifices is weak.","It treats withdrawal seizures in Liver patients.","It treats pox toxin entering the Heart.","This herb is used a yellow dye in the textile industry.","Both Yu Jin and Rz. Curcumae Longae Jiang Huang promote the movement of Qi and Blood and facilitate the Gall-bladder to eliminate jaundice. Yu Jin is stronger in this regard. Jiang Huang is warm rather than Cold, and treats Wind Bi which Yu Jin does not do. Yu Jin enters the Blood Level to cool Heat and break up Blood Stasis while promoting the flow of Qi at the Blood Level. It also clears Heat and relieves constraint which Jiang Huang does not do."]}
