roasted with salt water and warm the Stomach and heal dysentery when roasted with wine.","It clears Heart and Deficiency Heat, sores and ulcers when used raw.","It disperses Qi Stagnation when used with CX. Mori #{SangBaiPi} Sang Bai Pi.","For furuncle, subcutaneous ulcer, carbuncle of the back, appendicitis, mastitis, unidentified swelling, sudden malignant pain, high fever with aversion to Cold and Exogenous invasion grind 150g Huang Qi together with 150g Flos Lonicerae #{JinYinHua} Jin Yin Hua, 36g Rx. Angelicae Sinensis #{DangGui} Dang Gui, 30g Rx. Glycyrrhizae #{GanCao} Gan Cao. Take 6g of the powder, decoct into 1 1/2 cups of wine and boil down to 1 cup. If the disease is on the upper part of the body, take after meals. If it is on the lower part, take before meals and again shortly after the first administration.","It is better than Rx. Codonopsis #{DangShen} Dang Shen for Blood Deficiency.","This herb promotes other herbs, especially those that strengthen overall energy, digestion, Blood production and Blood circulation.","Both Huang Qi and Rx. Ginseng #{RenShen} Ren Shen tonify primal Qi. Huang Qi also supports the Yang and is most appropriate for disorders that involve sinking of clear Qi. It also stops sweating, promotes the discharge of pus, generates flesh and facilitates urination, none of which Ren Shen can do. Ren Shen also generates fluids and its tonic effect is stronger and longer lasting than Huang Qi.","Dry-fried Astragalus Chao Huang Qi has stronger Spleen warming and tonifying properties.","Wine-fried Astragalus Jiu Chao Huang Qi has a greater ability to reach the exterior and allows it to tonify without being cloying. It also is better able to treat Qi Deficiency patterns involving Cold, such as wheezing due to Qi Deficiency with Cold in the Lungs or Qi Deficiency with Cold in the Stomach causing diarrhea.","Honey-prepared Astragalus Mi Zhi Huang Qi allows the Huang Qi to travel internally to raise the clear Qi of the Middle Jiao. It is also slightly moistening and is appropriate when Blood Deficiency or Spleen Dryness is involved."]}
