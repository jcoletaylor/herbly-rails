Ginseng #{RenShen} Ren Shen but weaker.","Ginseng is used more for emergencies.","Dang Shen is good for Spleen Qi Deficiency with difficulty digesting.","This herb is said to beautify and freshen the skin.","Both Dang Shen and Rx. Ginseng Ren Shen have similar properties and functions. Ren Shen is much broader in its effects and must be used when the disorder is severe or requires immediate relief as in patterns of abandonment or profuse bleeding. Dang Shen tonifies Qi and indirectly augments Blood and Fluids, but does not tonify Yuan Qi or directly generate Fluids. Its effects are limited to the Spleen and Lungs and is less powerful than Ren Shen, although it is sufficient for everyday clinical use and is therefore a good substitute for Ren Shen when a Deficiency pattern is not severe. It is often used as an inexpensive substitute for Ren Shen.","Dry-fried Codonopsis Chao Dang Shen is warm and is better able to tonify the Spleen and Stomach. Frying with bran is more tonifying. Frying with white rice strengthens the Spleen, harmonizes the Stomach, reduces Food Stagnation and the potential cloying effect of tonification. Frying with yellow earth augments Spleen Qi, stops diarrhea and reduces nausea. Frying with Halloysitum Rubrum #{ChiShiZhi} Chi Shi Zhi enhances its ability to stop diarrhea and is appropriate for severe Spleen Deficiency with continuous diarrhea.","Prepared Codonopsis Zhi Dang Shen is prepared with honey and enables it to both tonify the Middle Jiao Qi and moisten Spleen Yin. to treat Spleen Qi and Yin Deficiency or Qi and Blood Deficiency."]}
