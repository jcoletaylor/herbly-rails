Mume #{WuMei} Wu Mei are astringents. Ying Su Ke more strongly enters the Lungs and Intestines to restrain and inhibit. It more readily affects the upper burner and most importantly secures and stabilizes the Kidney Qi and strongly relieves pain. Wu Mei is a strong astringent. It enters the Lungs to stop cough, enters the Intestines to stop diarrhea, enters the Qi level to restrain Deficiency Fire and enters the Blood to contain Yin and Blood to stop bleeding.","Both Ying Su Ke and Galla Chinensis #{WuBeiZi} Wu Bei Zi astringe the Lungs to alleviate cough and the Intestines to stop diarrhea. Wu Bei Zi is sour astringent and cold, weaker in astringing the Lungs and Intestines, it is more appropriate for descending Fire, resolving toxicity, generating Yang fluids, stopping bleeding, securing Jing and astringing sweat. Ying Su Ke is a stronger astringent and effectively reduces pain.","Ying Su Ke, Limonitum #{YuYuLiang} Yu Yu Liang and Halloysitum Rubrum #{ChiShiZhi} Chi Shi Zhi all bind the Intestines, stop diarrhea and stabilize to stop incessant uterine bleeding and are often combined to enhance these actions. Yu Yu Liang is heavier than Chi Shi Zhi, and astringes the lower Jiao, without tonifying or augmenting the Stomach, while Chi Shi Zhi being sweet and warm, augments the Qi, generates flesh, and adjusts the Middle. It is more appropriate for sores that fail to heal due to Qi Deficiency, and diarrhea or uterine bleeding disorders due to inability to securely store. Ying Su Ke is light in weight and slightly cold. It enters the Qi level and preserves the Lungs.","for patients in severe pain, Rz. Corydalis #{YanHuSuo} Yan Hu Suo may be used as a substitute as this herb may not readily be available.","Vinegar-fried Poppy Husk Cu Chao Ying Su Ke more strongly astringes the Intestines and is less likely to cause nausea. It is used to treat dysenteric disorders.","Honey-prepared Poppy Husk Mi Zhi Ying Su Ke is better at astringing the Lungs and is often used to treat chronic cough and wheezing."]}
