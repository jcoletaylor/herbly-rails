# Herbly - an Herb API for TCM Herbal Information

A Read-Only API for Herb data written in Ruby on Rails.

Initial source of data was from [American Dragon](https://www.americandragon.com/), developed by Dr. Joel Penner. He graciously permitted me to crawl his website and parse it into more structured data, to make it available for other more programmatic use. While the data here has been curated, revised, and built upon, this project and the associated projects would not be possible without his extraordinary efforts.

As the site was a very complex data set with decades of research cultivated, there were over time certain discrepancies in the structure of the HTML. This is not a critique, Dr. Penner did a frankly staggering job of keeping this data organized and the overall html structures consistent, which is the only thing that enabled crawling and parsing the data in the first place. While I have done my best to spot-check herbs and formulas for completeness, there are thousands, and thousands more connections and associations. There may be errors. If you find them, please feel free to reach out, I will do my best to correct them over time.

As always, this information is not meant to diagnose or suggest treatment for illness, complaint, or distress. Please consult a liscensed professional.
